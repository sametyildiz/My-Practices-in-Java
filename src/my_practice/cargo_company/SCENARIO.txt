The automation system for a cargo company has users such as:
administrators, 
branch employees, 
transportation personnel,
customers.


Administrators manage the system by
adding and removing branches, branch employees and transportation personnel.


Branch employees can enter and remove information about the shipments sent from that branch,
add and remove users (customers) to the system. The information of the sender and receiver
are recorded for each shipment. When the package arrives at a branch or leaves the branch,
its current status is entered into the system by the branch employee.

When it is delivered,
the transportation personnel makes the update.

The customer entering the system with the
tracking number is only authorized to see the name and surname information of the sender
and receiver and the current status of the cargo.
